Q What is the correct way to add dynamically objects with different name to an array ?
Q Think how you aim to implement the whole project (linking of project name with subtasks) 
Q finally dom manipulation

    1)-object which has property named subtask and it's data type is array.
        That array is empty initially and when tasks are added in task section it's value is added. ✅
    2) Key board functionality for the subtask. ✅

    1) Code refactoring    
    2) Create dom elements for the subtasks 
    2) Today and Month default Items in array
    - Makes subtasks also switch
